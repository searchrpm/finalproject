# Final Project

## Objectives
Final Project Specs:

* Description of data source:
Read and define images for famous monuments in the world
As a secondary option weâ€™ll define the location of the monument 

* Expected data cleaning steps to make the data useful for machine learning:
1. Aggregate the data from our data sources and create default image sizes (define sizes)
2. Order data inside CSV files (or Google Map API source)
3. Clean and organize data inside Jupyter Notebook
4.  Move data into data base (optional if needed)

* The machine learning models you plan on using:
Sci-Kit Learn, CNN and Xception for image accuracy

* What metrics you plan on using to evaluate the ml model
Xception for image classification and image accuracy 

* How you plan on demonstrating your model (web app, jupyter notebook)
Jupyter Notebook/Databricks/ 
(Optional) HTML/CSS/Bootstrap 

* How you plan on training the model (colab, personal computer, aws, Databricks)
Colab and Databricks to run image matching accuracy and recognition
